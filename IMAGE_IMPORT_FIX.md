# Image Fix Instructions

I've fixed the 404 error for your image by using direct imports instead of relying on the public folder. Here's what you need to do:

## Place Your Logo Image

1. Place your actual HackHertz logo image in this location:
   ```
   src/assets/hackhertz-logo.png
   ```

2. Make sure the file is named exactly `hackhertz-logo.png`

## Why This Works Better

- Using direct imports in Next.js is more reliable than public folder references
- The image will be properly optimized during build
- We've added the `priority` flag to ensure the logo loads quickly
- This approach works better with TypeScript and provides better type checking

## If You Still Have Issues

If you still encounter problems:

1. Make sure your PNG file is valid and not corrupted
2. Try using a different PNG file to confirm it's not an issue with the specific image
3. If you want to use a different filename, make sure to update the import in both:
   - `src/components/sections/hero-section.tsx` 
   - `src/components/layout/header.tsx`

## Alternative Solution

If direct imports don't work for any reason, you can also try placing your image in:
```
public/hackhertz.png
```

And then modify the Image component to use:
```tsx
<Image 
  src="/hackhertz.png" 
  alt="HackHertz Logo" 
  width={600}
  height={200}
  className="w-full h-auto object-contain"
  priority
/>
```
