# Image Import Fix Verification

It looks like there was a mismatch in the image imports. I've fixed it by:

1. Making both components import from the same file path: `@/assets/hackhertz.png`
2. Enhanced the Next.js config to better support image imports

## Steps to Verify the Fix

1. Make sure you have an actual PNG image file at:
   ```
   src/assets/hackhertz.png
   ```

2. Check if your project has properly configured the module paths in `tsconfig.json`. It should include something like:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "paths": {
         "@/*": ["./src/*"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart your development server with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **If the image still doesn't appear:**
   - The file might be corrupt - try using a different PNG file
   - There might be a webpack/Next.js config issue - try the alternative approach below

2. **Alternative Approach (using public folder):**
   - Place your image in: `public/images/hackhertz.png`
   - Update both components to use:
     ```tsx
     <Image 
       src="/images/hackhertz.png" 
       alt="HackHertz" 
       width={120}
       height={32}
       className="h-8 w-auto"
       priority
     />
     ```

## Technical Explanation

The error you're seeing is due to one of these issues:
1. The imported image file doesn't exist at the specified path
2. Next.js is having trouble processing the image file
3. There's a module resolution issue with the `@/assets/` path

By making both components use the same import path and updating the Next.js config, we should resolve these issues.
